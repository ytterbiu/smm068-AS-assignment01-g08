# Changelog

## Unreleased

### To Do

- Change `aligned` to `align*` throughout.
- Wrap `array` in display math (`$$ ... $$`) so it renders in PDF and HTML.
- Switch `round()` to `sprintf()` for fixed decimal formatting and PDF
  rendering.
- Fix array spacing - possibly create custom environment for answers for QOL.
- Ask Iqbal about GenAI declaration

#### Q1

- Add functionality to avoid repeated downloads from yahoo (can change this back
  for the R code submission).
- Add draft supplemental methodology describing the stock selection process in
  more detail and adding a bit of background information on the companies -
  potentially in a table?

#### Q2

- TBC

#### Q3

- Create `ggplot` versions of the figures, complete with figure captions.
- Test 2x2 or 2x1 plot format for difference and PDF/CDF ease of comparison.
- Add description of what the pdf/cdf distribution means by method of comparison
  for both figures (saving space for Q3g) - i.e., higher probability of
  more/less extreme results / higher excess kurtosis(?)
- Look into adding table comparing the pdf & cdf of asset 1 & 2 (`kable`)
