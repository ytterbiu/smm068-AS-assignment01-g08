## Formatting guide

Making notes here for collaboration using rmd format:

- If using `align*` ensure that it isn't wrapped in math mode
- Add `<!-- prettier-ignore -->` before `align*` environment
- Avoid putting + or - at the start of a new line within an `align*` environment
- Use `$$ (maths) $$` for display math mode for consistency, rather than
  `\[ and \]`
- This character `−` raises warning in X&#x018E;LaTeX, have replaced throughout
  with `-`
